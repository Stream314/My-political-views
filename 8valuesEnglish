Option Explanation
Question: Corporate oppression is more concerning than government oppression.
Neutral
Explanation: Reality is difficult to define and requires analysis on a case-by-case basis. In some large companies, the 996 work schedule is corporate oppression, while in state-owned enterprises, it is government oppression. Ultimately, this depends on who holds the power; the powerful will oppress the weak, regardless of whether the powerful act with subjective intent.

Question: The government should intervene in the economy to protect consumers.
Strongly Agree
Explanation: The core purpose of businesses is to make profits, so they may exploit consumers. As a neutral third party, the government must ensure consumer rights and find a balance between corporate profits and consumer interests to maintain social stability.

Question: The freer the market, the freer the people.  
Strongly disagree  
Explanation: A free market without regulation not only leads to extreme price fluctuations and instability but also allows monopolies and illicit goods like weapons, drugs, and organs to appear in the market, which is extremely dangerous.

Question: Maintaining budget balance is better than ensuring the welfare of all citizens.  
Strongly agree  
Explanation: People have the right to know and the right not to know. North Korea is a good example. Extreme accommodation of environmentalism and egalitarianism led to corporate bankruptcy. Sustainable progress is better than short-term massive progress at the expense of long-term interests, as instability can lead to the collapse of governance and social turmoil.

Question: Government-funded research is more beneficial to the people than research conducted by the market.
Neutral
Explanation: Government-funded research is currently generally slower than market research, depending on the specific historical context. For example, during the wars of the last century, most technology was developed through government funding, driven by the urgent need for military advancement. Today, however, the primary drivers are corporate profits and technological progress.

Question: International trade tariffs are crucial for encouraging local production.
Strongly agree
Explanation: This is evident, as shown by the example of the April U.S. tariffs causing global stock markets to plummet. Tariffs are a crucial economic factor today, but specific issues require specific analysis, and no universal conclusions can be drawn.

Question: Each contributes according to their ability and receives according to their needs.
Strongly agree
Explanation: This is the ideal of communism, but this ideal can be viewed from multiple angles. From a practical standpoint, I believe it is impossible to achieve, The main reason is the high degree of uncertainty in human nature; there will always be those who exploit loopholes. However, in the long term, I believe this is achievable under certain conditions, such as extreme material abundance or an optimal distribution mechanism. This is why I favor algorithmic distribution, which requires algorithms and computational power that are either extremely perfect or beyond their time. Classification will no longer be based on class but on each individual, enabling comprehensive surveillance and calculation of every person. Everything would be regulated by artificial intelligence, eliminating individual instability and uncertainty. For example, by extensively studying and categorizing human behavior, and using big data calculations to preemptively avoid unstable or dangerous behavior. For instance, in the case of the 9/11 attacks, where extremist terrorists from the Middle East came to the United States to learn how to fly airplanes, if there had been extremely powerful computational power and algorithmic monitoring at the time, this danger could have been halted or redirected toward a safe direction from the very beginning. I don't fully understand my own comprehensive vision yet, but I believe the future world will become a safe and stable “each takes what they need, each contributes what they can” society, likely driven by extreme algorithms and reasonable distribution mechanisms.

Question: It would be best to abolish social programs and instead support private charitable initiatives.
Neutral
Explanation: As mentioned earlier, the society I envision is one where there are no distinctions between individuals, families, regions, or nations. Everything will be calculated on an individual basis, and artificial intelligence will guide everyone toward the “correct” path. Therefore, there is no need to consider these issues, though they may arise during the transitional phase. However, at the current stage, I do not believe that either social welfare programs or private charitable initiatives are worthy of endorsement. For instance, the Chinese Red Cross has been involved in questionable activities, and even top-tier foreign billionaires like Bill Gates, who, on the surface, donate to charity but are actually putting on a show, with their assets ultimately becoming trusts controlled and used by themselves. They merely don a moral halo while engaging in shameful deeds. However, I do not completely dismiss charity and social causes. For example, Vim's assistance to Uganda is commendable.

Question: Should taxes on the wealthy be increased to subsidize the poor?  
Agree  
Explanation: As mentioned earlier, with everything controlled by artificial intelligence, there is no such thing as wealth disparity or taxes. However, it is not an absolute equality or average. At the current stage, increasing taxes on the wealthy can help alleviate the widening wealth gap and maintain social stability.  

Question: Inheritance is a legitimate form of wealth.  
Strongly agree  
Explanation: As mentioned earlier, with everything controlled by artificial intelligence
