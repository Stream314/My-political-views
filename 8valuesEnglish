Option Explanation
Question: Corporate oppression is more concerning than government oppression.
Neutral
Explanation: Reality is difficult to define and requires analysis on a case-by-case basis. In some large companies, the 996 work schedule is corporate oppression, while in state-owned enterprises, it is government oppression. Ultimately, this depends on who holds the power; the powerful will oppress the weak, regardless of whether the powerful act with subjective intent.

Question: The government should intervene in the economy to protect consumers.
Strongly Agree
Explanation: The core purpose of businesses is to make profits, so they may exploit consumers. As a neutral third party, the government must ensure consumer rights and find a balance between corporate profits and consumer interests to maintain social stability.

Question: The freer the market, the freer the people.  
Strongly disagree  
Explanation: A free market without regulation not only leads to extreme price fluctuations and instability but also allows monopolies and illicit goods like weapons, drugs, and organs to appear in the market, which is extremely dangerous.

Question: Maintaining budget balance is better than ensuring the welfare of all citizens.  
Strongly agree  
Explanation: People have the right to know and the right not to know. North Korea is a good example. Extreme accommodation of environmentalism and egalitarianism led to corporate bankruptcy. Sustainable progress is better than short-term massive progress at the expense of long-term interests, as instability can lead to the collapse of governance and social turmoil.

Question: Government-funded research is more beneficial to the people than research conducted by the market.
Neutral
Explanation: Government-funded research is currently generally slower than market research, depending on the specific historical context. For example, during the wars of the last century, most technology was developed through government funding, driven by the urgent need for military advancement. Today, however, the primary drivers are corporate profits and technological progress.

Question: International trade tariffs are crucial for encouraging local production.
Strongly agree
Explanation: This is evident, as shown by the example of the April U.S. tariffs causing global stock markets to plummet. Tariffs are a crucial economic factor today, but specific issues require specific analysis, and no universal conclusions can be drawn.

Question: Each contributes according to their ability and receives according to their needs.
Strongly agree
Explanation: This is the ideal of communism, but this ideal can be viewed from multiple angles. From a practical standpoint, I believe it is impossible to achieve, The main reason is the high degree of uncertainty in human nature; there will always be those who exploit loopholes. However, in the long term, I believe this is achievable under certain conditions, such as extreme material abundance or an optimal distribution mechanism. This is why I favor algorithmic distribution, which requires algorithms and computational power that are either extremely perfect or beyond their time. Classification will no longer be based on class but on each individual, enabling comprehensive surveillance and calculation of every person. Everything would be regulated by artificial intelligence, eliminating individual instability and uncertainty. For example, by extensively studying and categorizing human behavior, and using big data calculations to preemptively avoid unstable or dangerous behavior. For instance, in the case of the 9/11 attacks, where extremist terrorists from the Middle East came to the United States to learn how to fly airplanes, if there had been extremely powerful computational power and algorithmic monitoring at the time, this danger could have been halted or redirected toward a safe direction from the very beginning. I don't fully understand my own comprehensive vision yet, but I believe the future world will become a safe and stable “each takes what they need, each contributes what they can” society, likely driven by extreme algorithms and reasonable distribution mechanisms.

Question: It would be best to abolish social programs and instead support private charitable initiatives.
Neutral
Explanation: As mentioned earlier, the society I envision is one where there are no distinctions between individuals, families, regions, or nations. Everything will be calculated on an individual basis, and artificial intelligence will guide everyone toward the “correct” path. Therefore, there is no need to consider these issues, though they may arise during the transitional phase. However, at the current stage, I do not believe that either social welfare programs or private charitable initiatives are worthy of endorsement. For instance, the Chinese Red Cross has been involved in questionable activities, and even top-tier foreign billionaires like Bill Gates, who, on the surface, donate to charity but are actually putting on a show, with their assets ultimately becoming trusts controlled and used by themselves. They merely don a moral halo while engaging in shameful deeds. However, I do not completely dismiss charity and social causes. For example, Vim's assistance to Uganda is commendable.

Question: Should taxes on the wealthy be increased to subsidize the poor?  
Agree  
Explanation: As mentioned earlier, with everything controlled by artificial intelligence, there is no such thing as wealth disparity or taxes. However, it is not an absolute equality or average. At the current stage, increasing taxes on the wealthy can help alleviate the widening wealth gap and maintain social stability.  

Question: Inheritance is a legitimate form of wealth.
I strongly agree.
Explanation: As mentioned earlier, everything is controlled by artificial intelligence, so there is no such thing as wealth. However, at the current stage, it is impossible for children to receive no inheritance at all after their parents' death. Therefore, we need to find a balance. Personally, I still support inheritance at this stage. However, I believe that in the future, since all resources will be regulated by artificial intelligence, individuals will have achieved self-sufficiency, and in a sense, this will be true global sharing, perhaps even achieving “communism.” Of course, I believe that transitioning to the ideal society I envision will require time and effort, and it may not be a peaceful transition—violence and bloodshed could arise. However, I hope it can evolve peacefully through some technological means.

Question: Basic infrastructure such as roads and electricity should be publicly owned.  
Strongly agree  
Explanation: As mentioned earlier, this will not be the case in the future, but at the current stage, resources as ubiquitous as roads and electricity cannot be used for profit. If used for profit, they will inevitably evolve into monopolies and a “this mountain is mine, this tree is mine” bandit-like model. For the stability of society, public ownership is the best option at present.

Question: Government intervention poses a threat to the economy.
Neutral
Explanation: This still requires a case-by-case analysis. Sometimes it does, such as the extreme planned economy of the former Soviet Union, which was essentially monopolistic state capitalism. However, similarly, the contributions of the Chinese government to economic development during the reform and opening-up period are also undeniable.

Issue: Those with stronger payment capabilities should enjoy better healthcare.
Strongly agree
Explanation: What else can be done? At this stage, everyone should bear the cost of their own health. Those with the means, like the JD Vice President with ALS, can afford it, while those without the means receive conservative treatment. Conservative treatment is very common in county and village hospitals—this is the reality.

Question: Quality education is a right for everyone.  
Strongly disagree  
Explanation: The concept of “quality education” is abstract and elusive. Even if we assume that educational resources are equally distributed, it does not mean that everyone should receive exactly the same education. In any case, this issue is highly complex and requires extensive categorization and discussion. In general, I believe that everyone should receive the education most suitable for their individual needs.

Question: Means of production should belong to the workers who use them.  
Disagree  
Explanation: This issue will not exist in the future, as everyone will receive the means of production most suitable for them. In general, this issue is highly complex and requires extensive categorization and discussion. At the present stage, this issue is sometimes almost irrelevant. For example, whether a taxi driver drives a car owned by a state-owned company or a private car for ride-hailing services makes little practical difference. On the other hand, some means of production, such as lithography machines and other high-precision industrial equipment, are extremely dangerous when controlled by individuals, as they inevitably lead to monopolies. Can you imagine a private individual in China owning the most advanced lithography machine? In my view, this is absolutely impossible. In most cases, it is better for production resources not to be owned by individuals.

Question: The United Nations should be abolished.  
Neutral  
Explanation: It's hard to say. At present, the United Nations still serves a significant purpose. However, if the ideal world I envision were to be realized in the future, the United Nations would likely be abandoned by history, much like the League of Nations.

Question: Our country often needs to take military action to protect itself.  
Strongly agree  
Explanation: Having a sword and not using it are two different things. Most of the time, the world respects the strong. As the side with the “sword,” we have the right to be respected and choose peace.

Question: I support regional alliances, such as the European Union.  
Strongly agree  
Explanation: Perhaps the ideal world I envision is a global alliance.

Question: Maintaining our national sovereignty is very important.  
Strongly agree  
Explanation: Basic rights and respect require no further explanation.

Question: A unified world government would benefit humanity.  
Strongly agree
Explanation: This aligns with my ideals. Honestly, I am heartbroken to see resources being wasted and destroyed, such as Ukraine's black soil now abandoned due to war and even littered with landmines, or Siberia's land, the minerals of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Africa, the talent of Mexico and India, and so on. Humanity should not be trapped in mutual suspicion and disputes, constantly at war. One day, we will build our own true “Tower of Babel.”

Question: Maintaining peaceful relations is more important than strengthening our capabilities.
Strongly disagree
Explanation: Only with strong capabilities can we choose peace; otherwise, we will fall into the situation described in the saying, “Today we cede five cities, tomorrow ten cities, and then we may have a night of peace. But when we rise to survey the borders, the Qin troops have already arrived again.”

Question: War does not need to be explained to other countries.
Neutral
Explanation: This is still a complex issue that requires extensive discussion, such as China's reunification with Taiwan. In general, a nation's actions are closely observed by other nations. Today, major global powers possess the technology and capability to monitor your actions. If no explanation is required, it likely resembles the situation in The Three-Body Problem, where “the master does not care,” due to extreme disparities in strength. Thus, no explanation is needed—just as one does not explain to an ant why it was crushed, perhaps merely for amusement.

Question: Military spending is a waste of money.
Strongly oppose
Explanation: Extreme militarism is wrong, but as mentioned earlier, strength is the most basic form of dignity, and military spending is part of our strength, so it is absolutely not a waste of money. Perhaps there are instances of waste and corruption, such as the exorbitant cost of American fighter jets, which is also the fundamental reason behind Musk's massive layoffs and government streamlining at the beginning of the year.

Question: International aid is a waste of money.
Neutral
Explanation: Not necessarily. It depends on the specific recipients of aid and the international environment. Overall, this issue is complex and requires a case-by-case analysis.

Question: My nation is great.
Agree
Explanation: I still have a sense of identity with my Chinese nation, though not to an extreme degree.

Question: Research should be conducted on an international scale.
Strongly agree
Explanation: Ideally, science knows no borders, but reality is different. However, in my ideal future, this will be achieved.

Question: Governments should be accountable to the international community.
Neutral
Explanation: “When one is poor, one should cultivate oneself; when one is prosperous, one should benefit the world.” One should first manage one's own affairs before taking responsibility for others.

Question: Even when protesting against an authoritarian government, violence is unacceptable.
Disagree
Explanation: Violence can be acceptable, but the key is how it is used, not completely abandoning it, as violence is actually part of one's strength.

Question: My religious values should be spread as widely as possible.
Neutral
Explanation: Religious culture should spread naturally. If it is a strategic invasion, that is another matter, such as Japan's transformation of Taiwan and Manchuria.

Question: Our country's values should be spread as widely as possible.
Neutral
Explanation: Same as above

Question: Maintaining law and order is very important.
Strongly agree
Explanation: Law and order are the core of stability, and I care deeply about stability.

Question: The general public has made the wrong decision.
Agree
Explanation: Sometimes the public makes the wrong decision, mostly because they cannot and should not have access to all the information. They are a mob.

Question: Doctors should be allowed to assist in suicide.
Disagree
Explanation: This issue has been widely discussed online, mainly because it could lead to organ and human trafficking. However, I did not choose to strongly oppose it because it leaves a path for severely injured and critically ill patients to reduce and alleviate their suffering.

Question: Sacrificing some civil liberties is necessary to protect us from terrorist acts.
Agree
Explanation: Health and safety are synonymous with stability, but excessively sacrificing and restricting civil liberties under the pretext of protecting us from terrorist acts is wrong.

Question: Government surveillance is necessary in the modern world.
Strongly agree
Explanation: Previously explained.

Question: The very existence of the state poses a threat to our freedom.  
Disagree  
Explanation: The stable and secure environment we enjoy today is provided by the state. While it may not be entirely so, the state certainly plays a dominant role. The price of freedom is security, which is unacceptable.

Question: Regardless of political views, it is important to stand with one's own country.
Disagree
Explanation: Do not become part of the ignorant masses who blindly follow the state and authority. Have your own thoughts. Do not follow the crowd just because everyone else is doing it, even if it is wrong. For example, the Nazi genocide. However, in extreme cases, if not standing with the state leads to personal safety and health issues, then one must stand with the state. For example, the Soviet Union and the KGB's speech control.

Question: All authority should be questioned.
Strongly agree
Explanation: This is obvious and requires no further explanation.

Question: A hierarchical system is the best.
Neutral
Explanation: This is a complex issue that requires extensive discussion, and there is no universal conclusion.

Question: It is important for the government to listen to the opinions of the majority, even if they are wrong.
Strongly disagree
Explanation: Do not choose the wrong path to satisfy the majority. Stay firmly on the correct path, but ensure stability and security. Do not resort to violent revolution unless there is a guarantee of victory.

Question: The stronger the leadership, the better.  
Strongly agree  
Explanation: As mentioned earlier, my ideal is an extreme form of correct dictatorship, where artificial intelligence rules. Clearly, the stronger the leadership of the artificial intelligence rulers, the better.

Question: Democracy is more than just a decision-making process.
Disagree
Explanation: I do not support democracy.

Question: Environmental regulations are crucial.
Agree
Explanation: Between development and the environment, we need to make trade-offs. Sustainable development is what we need, and in special circumstances, productivity can take priority, so I did not choose “strongly agree.”

Question: Automation, science, and technology will create a better world.
Strongly agree
Explanation: This is exactly what my ideal world needs.

Question: Children should be educated in religious or traditional values.  
Neutral  
Explanation: I have always maintained a neutral stance on religious and traditional values education, primarily because of the existence of extreme religious fanatics, such as Middle Eastern Muslim terrorists. I believe that religious and traditional education can lead individuals to lose their ability to think and judge independently, becoming blind followers of authority and making irrational decisions.

Question: Tradition itself has no value.
Strongly disagree
Explanation: Tradition must have its value. Any existing thing must have its reason for existence. As the saying goes, “existence is justified.” I personally believe that history and traditional culture are the partial optimal solutions humanity has derived from facing various problems in the past, much like computer logs. We need the past and can certainly find its essence within it. We should take the essence and discard the dross.

Question: Religion should play a role in government.  
Strongly disagree  
Explanation: As mentioned earlier, religion often causes people to lose their rationality, while the operation of government requires science and rationality.  

Question: Churches should pay taxes like other institutions.  
Strongly agree  
Explanation: Religion is not a special reason, especially since I am an atheist with no religious inclinations.  

Question: Climate change is one of the greatest threats to our way of life today.
Agree
Explanation: I acknowledge that climate change has a significant impact on us, but it is far from being as dire as it is portrayed. The primary threat at present is the geopolitical rivalry between major powers. Do you think soldiers on the front lines in Russia-Ukraine care about the melting of polar ice caps or a one or two-degree rise in temperature? They have been sent to the front lines as disposable pawns in national rivalry, with their lives hanging in the balance. Most of the time, humanity is engaged in self-destructive conflict.

Question: It is important that we unite and work together to address climate change.
Strongly agree
Explanation: We certainly need to. It would be wonderful if the entire world could truly unite.

Question: Society was better many years ago than it is now.
Disagree
Explanation: I’m not so sure. I still think today’s economy and development are better than in the past. Were the Cold War and World War II better than today? At least in the past century, we have been on an upward trend, either increasing steadily or spiraling upward.

Question: It is very important to preserve our past traditions.  
Agree  
Explanation: The past is our roots; without roots, it is dangerous. This is why humanity continuously explores past history and our own origins. However, the future is more important than the past.

Question: It is important that we think long-term, beyond our own lifespans.
Strongly agree
Explanation: We cannot limit ourselves to our own finite lives and make wrong judgments.

Question: Rationality is more important than preserving our culture.
Agree
Explanation: Scientific ideals are more important than traditional culture. We cannot blindly adhere to tradition, but we must also respect it, as mentioned earlier, existence is reasonable.

Question: Drug use should be legalized or decriminalized.  
Agree  
Explanation: I am not advocating drug use, but I hope that legalization can distinguish those inherently unstable individuals who negatively impact society. Some people are inherently problematic and should not be allowed to remain hidden within society. They should be given the opportunity to self-destruct, and then swift action should be taken to remove the societal scourge.

Question: No culture is superior to another.  
Disagree  
Explanation: I also hope the world is equal, but reality is not. Clearly, there are better cultures and worse cultures. For example, the cannibalistic culture of African tribes is clearly inferior to a rational, rule-of-law society. Some backward cultures exist simply because their real-world conditions have not provided them with better opportunities. As mentioned earlier, culture is a locally optimal solution to past problems.

Question: Extramarital sexual behavior is immoral.  
Agree  
Explanation: Extramarital sexual behavior is indeed immoral, but personally, I do not support marriage, as the institution of marriage has become somewhat outdated.

Question: If we accept immigrants, it is important to integrate them into our culture.
Agree
Explanation: We are not trying to assimilate them into being exactly like us, but from the moment they start speaking our language, they are already integrating into our culture.

Question: Abortion should be prohibited in most or all cases.
Strongly disagree
Explanation: Abortion is a personal freedom that does not concern others. Everyone should be responsible for themselves and their offspring, but it is possible that in the future, socialized childcare will be implemented, and the concepts of parents and family will become less important.

Question: People without a valid reason should be prohibited from owning guns.
Strongly agree
Explanation: Why would anyone need a gun without a valid reason? Guns are dangerous weapons.

Question: I support a single-payer, universal healthcare system.
Undecided
Explanation: I don't understand what a single-payer system means, but I think this issue is similar to the previous one about equal healthcare conditions.

Question: Prostitution should be illegal.
Disagree
Explanation: To be honest, prostitution is hard to define nowadays. People are too pragmatic, and love is elusive. Some people just use the pretext of dating to engage in prostitution.

Question: Maintaining family values is crucial.
Disagree
Explanation: Explained earlier.

Question: Pursuing progress at all costs is dangerous.
Neutral
Explanation: Progress within stability.

Question: Genetic modification is a force for good, even for humans.
Strongly agree
Explanation: I am a transhumanist.

Question: We should open our borders to immigrants.
Disagree
Explanation: Immigration needs to be controlled.

Question: The government should care about foreigners as much as it cares about its own citizens.
Disagree
Explanation: As explained earlier, take care of your own first, then others.

Question: Everyone—regardless of cultural or gender factors—should be treated equally.
Strongly disagree
Explanation: Similar questions were addressed earlier; no further details will be provided.

Question: The most important thing is to achieve our team's goals.
Strongly agree
Explanation: Achieving goals is the most important thing.
